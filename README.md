# SeniorProject19 - "Time-Off"

#Senior Project Course Fall of 2019 | Pennsylvania College of Technology

This website application was built for RegScan Inc. in Williamsport PA. Time-Off is a website that allows RegScan employees to request
accrued personal and/or vacation time.

#Problem Identification
RegScan’s current time off system uses outdated resources and requires constant maintenance for data accuracy. The data being stored is redundant along with other backend processes.

#Summary of Tech Stack
I used SQL Server Management Studio to create my relational database and I linked my database with Visual Studio inserting a data context class to connect my database to my application. Using Entity Framework, I was able to easily manipulate and maintain my data within my database. 

#Objectives

- Employees will be able to securely login in with their own protected credentials 

- The application validates users input making sure the system is working off accurate data 

- The application will store data in perpetuity for HR’s record keeping on personnel records, or in accordance with company document-retention policy  

- Implementation of google calendar to collectively view other employees approved time off on a calendar  

- Employees will be able to access the website from any computer within RegScans network 

- Both the user and their department manager will receive a confirmation email that encloses details about the request just submitted. 

- Previous submitted time off can be fixed or modified 

- Implementation of a user-friendly calendar for the user logged in 

- Application includes an Administrative section to conveniently create/edit users 

#Design
I used the drag and drop features for the user interface and implemeneted jQuery for features like the drop down box for date selection in the form of a calendar.
